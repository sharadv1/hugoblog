Great discussion on the economy with [[Whitney Baker]], a macro economist who worked in leadership roles at Soros Fund Management and Bridgewater Associates.  The discussion happened on [[Joe Lonsdale]]'s podcast American Optimist. Lonsdale is a co-founder of [[Palantir]], the analytics/AI company with deep ties to the defense/intelligence industry and currently in a kerfluffle with Paul Graham on X.

Baker believes inflation is not coming down. Household incomes are going up 8-10% from last year and job growth is 2% while growth is 6-7% per year. Spending will increase as a result of these trends.

If your economy has a shortage of goods, which will be the case with tariffs and deglobalization, then every marginal dollar goes to price instead of volume, ie you get fewer, more expensive things instead of more, less expensive things.

Inflation looked like it went down bc global demand for goods fell.  Rest of world debt is floating rate. Global recessions create a temporary drag on goods prices.  But goods prices are increasing again as ROW recovers. 
  

On AI, she believes the key questions are: 

- Will productivity gains be distributed broadly or be concentrated within the oligopolies  
- How long with ai take to be transmitted to real productivity gains

It is a race between ai producing real productivity gains and the rebound in inflation
